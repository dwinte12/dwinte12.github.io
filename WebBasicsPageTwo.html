Who I am
</h2>

<p>
My name is Darcy Winter, and I use they/them pronouns. I’m based in New York, NY. I got my undergraduate degree in history from SUNY University at Buffalo. I have two wonderful cats who still live in Buffalo. The black one is Bob and the multicolored one is named Lovett. </p>

<p>This is my cat, Bob. We adopted him when I was in middle school. He acts more like a dog than a cat and likes to beg and steal food.</p>

Since beginning college in Buffalo, I’ve gotten really into sports. It’s nearly impossible to go to school in Buffalo without becoming fond of the Bills. My mom is a die-hard Bills fan, but I would say I am a casual enjoyer. I also like the Giants and the Ravens. The Ravens were the first and only professional football team I have ever seen play in person. Plus they have the best uniform. Since moving to New York, I have also gotten very into the baseball culture here. I was raised to be a Mets fan and now I think I can say that I am. Watching the city get so excited for the post-season has been really fun!</p>

<h2>
My background in the arts
</h2>
    <br>
<p> 
I have been making art since I was 3 years old. I’ve learned myriad methods and techniques in all sorts of fields. I can paint, draw, sew, crochet, act, and sing! I like to say it runs in my family, and I am proud to carry on the passion for the creative process. Below are pictures of some of my art throughout the years:
